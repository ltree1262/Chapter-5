JSON: JavaScript Object Notation.
JSON is a syntax for storing and exchanging data.
JSON is text, written with JavaScript object notation.

JSON Example
{"employees":[
    { "firstName":"John", "lastName":"Doe" },
    { "firstName":"Anna", "lastName":"Smith" },
    { "firstName":"Peter", "lastName":"Jones" }
]}

XML Example
<employees>
    <employee>
        <firstName>John</firstName> <lastName>Doe</lastName>
    </employee>
    <employee>
        <firstName>Anna</firstName> <lastName>Smith</lastName>
    </employee>
    <employee>
        <firstName>Peter</firstName> <lastName>Jones</lastName>
    </employee>
</employees>

 JSON is Like XML Because
Both JSON and XML are "self describing" (human readable)
Both JSON and XML are hierarchical (values within values)
Both JSON and XML can be parsed and used by lots of programming languages
Both JSON and XML can be fetched with an XMLHttpRequest

JSON is Unlike XML Because
JSON doesn't use end tag
JSON is shorter
JSON is quicker to read and write
JSON can use arrays

The biggest difference is:

 XML has to be parsed with an XML parser. JSON can be parsed by a standard JavaScript function.

Why JSON is Better Than XML
XML is much more difficult to parse than JSON.
JSON is parsed into a ready-to-use JavaScript object.
